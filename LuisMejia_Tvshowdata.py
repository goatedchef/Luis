# def inFile():
#the user would have to input a file.txt
#this will check if file is correct
#return file

#def getData():
#this function will get all of the Data into Lists
#then it will return all lists needed for other functions
#return Title , Rating , Year , score lists

#def getchoice():
#Have print statements for the user to see in order to make a choice
#return int of said choice made

#def getspecrating(Titlelist, ratinglist)
#have a linear search where a for loops i will be index for both titel and rating and checking 
##rating as it goes down the list
#return index of all rating titles with specific rating

#def highestscoreyears(scorelist, startyear, endyear)
# by the way the start and end will be asked in the main While loop
#I will use a loop for this because if end year is over the len of the socre list 
#it will give out a -1 for erorr
#return index for said hiest score 

#def searchyear(Titlelist, titleinput)
#I will get the title name before calling this function in from main
#I will use a binaray search in order to find the title in a quicker fashsion
#this function will return the index which will be used for finding the title

#def findaverage(Ratinglist, ratinginput)
#the input will be assigned in the main function
# I will use lists to my advantage inorder to deivide the average rating with all the shows in the list 
#return veragescore

#def findhieghtest(title, score, treshold)
#im gonna get the threshold before this function is calle din the main function
#I will use the treshold and the score to simultainiusly get index for the higest score and the titles
#and put them in a list
#this will print said title and score at the same time

#def sortyears(title, rating, score, year):
#mabe making the years into an integer so i can make it into
#heighest i honestly don't know or maybe i honestly don't know maybe like sort it by compare each year with title
#opens new file and input write into our new sorted lists

#def main():
#main will be where the choice number goes into then makes the specific choice algorithim 
#in order to do this make a while loop of != and if eroor in choice else would be erorr then get choice again
